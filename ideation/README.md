# Purpose of this folder

This folder is where I am tracking the process of ideation for this card game which will be used to promote my movie

# What it contains

Prompts I have written for organizing my idea for the game into organized documentation in case I need to
retrace my steps in the future as well as general documentation I have written outlining my intention and design 
for the card game based prize distribution system on the movie's website. 

# My Plan tl;dr 

I am going to write the python modules for the games logic first , then I will begin to fuck with making the integration
with the MariaDB database clean and efficient, finally I will fuck with figuring out the web framework integration and how
I'm going to make that happen with zero money lol
